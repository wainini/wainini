      <td valign="text-top">A tower-defense game themed around human immune system. This game was made for PkM (Pengabdian Kepada Masyarakat) BGDC 2022 with other BGDC members. Immunopedia is a game where you need to know and understand what each unit can do, be it ally or enemy.</td>
      <td valign="text-top">This game the first game that I got fully made and released. Work Less Play More is a 2D beat-em-up game with a unique mechanic where you need to avoid your boss attention. The game was made for Brackeys Game Jam 2022.1 with the theme "This is not real".<br></td>

      <td valign="text-top">This one was made for Ludum Dare 50 which theme was "Delay the inevitable". It's a simple top-down survival game. The caveat is that your HP is always decreasing, making you always on the run for the randomly spawned heals.</td>
      <td valign="text-top">Interstellar Janitor is my try at making tile-based movement and some dialogue system. The game itself was made for Brackeys Game Jam 2022.2 and was themed around the Jam theme "You're not alone". It's a logic puzzle game where you need to read clues scattered around the spaceship to deduce some objects that might just be an alien in disguise.<br></td>
