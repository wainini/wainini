Nice to meet you! I'm currently a student at Bina Nusantara University, majoring in Game Application and Technology ðŸŽ®

I've worked on numerous game projects on Unity. Most of the projects I'm in are small in size (game jams), but some are bigger projects. 
Which you can find on [my itch.io](https://wainini.itch.io)
