Nice to meet you! I'm currently a student at Bina Nusantara University, majoring in Game Application and Technology ðŸŽ®

I've worked on numerous game projects on Unity. Most of the projects I'm in are small in size (game jams), but some are bigger projects. 
Which you can find on [my itch.io](https://wainini.itch.io)

## Here are highlights from some of the games I made:


## [Immunopedia ðŸ¦ ](https://bgdc.itch.io/immunopedia)

A tower-defense game themed around human immune system. This game was made for PkM (Pengabdian Kepada Masyarakat) BGDC 2022 with other BGDC members. Immunopedia is a game where you need to know and understand what each unit can do, be it ally or enemy.

## [Work Less Play More ðŸŽ®](https://bgdc.itch.io/work-less-play-more)

This game the first game that I got fully made and released. Work Less Play More is a 2D beat-em-up game with a unique mechanic where you need to avoid your boss attention. The game was made for Brackeys Game Jam 2022.1 with the theme "This is not real".

## [Keep Yourself Alive ðŸ’€](https://bgdc.itch.io/keep-yourself-alive)

This one was made for Ludum Dare 50 which theme was "Delay the inevitable". It's a simple top-down survival game. The caveat is that your HP is always decreasing, making you always on the run for the randomly spawned heals.

## [Interstellar Janitor ðŸ§¹](https://bgdc.itch.io/interstellar-janitor)
![](https://github.com/wainini/wainini/blob/main/interstellar%20janitor%20%20low%20res.gif)

Interstellar Janitor is my try at making tile-based movement and some dialogue system. The game itself was made for Brackeys Game Jam 2022.2 and was themed around the Jam theme "You're not alone". It's a logic puzzle game where you need to read clues scattered around the spaceship to deduce some objects that might just be an alien in disguise.
