|This game the first game that I got fully made and released. <br> Work Less Play More is a 2D beat-em-up game with a unique mechanic <br> where you need to avoid your boss attention. The game was made for <br> Brackeys Game Jam 2022.1 with the theme "This is not real".|

This one was made for Ludum Dare 50 which theme was "Delay the inevitable". <br> It's a simple top-down survival game. The caveat is that your HP is always decreasing, <br> making you always on the run for the randomly spawned heals.

|Interstellar Janitor is my try at making tile-based movement <br> and some dialogue system. The game itself was made for Brackeys Game Jam 2022.2 <br> and was themed around the Jam theme "You're not alone". <br> It's a logic puzzle game where you need to read clues scattered around <br> the spaceship to deduce some objects that might just be an alien in disguise.|
